# printable_paper

A collection of printable paper. The file names inside `printable_paper` can be interpreted using the following key:

- "single", "double" means a single A4 page or an A4 page divided into two A5 pages

- "lines", "dots", "linesdots" means lined, dotted and line-dotted paper respectively (the lat option is inspired by some interesting, Japanese me thinks, stationary)

- "5mm", "6mm", "college" means 5mm, 6mm or college ruled spacing

- "smallmargin", "mediummargin", "largemargin" means small, medium or large margins

- "light" means lighter dots and lines

The files were created with `paper_dot_line.nb`. I haven't tried them all, my favorite is:

"double_linesdots_6mm_smallmargin_light.pdf"

I like the idea of having both lines and dots. The lines guide your writing and the dots are
useful when some precision is needed for drawing.

Enjoy!
