# printable_paper

A collection of printable paper. The file names inside `printable_paper` can be interpreted using the following key:

- "single", "double" means a single A4 page or an A4 page divided into two A5 pages

- "iso" means isometric lined A4 paper with vertical lines (lines of dots) along the long edge, 
  "isohorizontal" means isometric A4 lined paper with horizontal lines (lines of dots) along the short edge

- "lines", "dots", "linesdots" means lined, dotted and line-dotted paper respectively (the lat option is inspired by some interesting, Japanese me thinks, stationary)

- "5mm", "6mm", "college" means 5mm, 6mm or college ruled spacing 
  - for isometric paper with lines only or dots only this is the distance between the
    closests points
  - for isometric paper with lines and dots this is the distance between the lines

- "smallmargin", "mediummargin", "largemargin" means small, medium or large margins

- "light" means lighter dots and lines

The files were created with `paper_dot_line.nb`. I haven't tried them all, my favorite is:

"double_linesdots_6mm_smallmargin_light.pdf"

I like the idea of having both lines and dots. The lines guide your writing and the dots are
useful when some precision is needed for drawing.

Enjoy!
